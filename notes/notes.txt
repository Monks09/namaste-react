* React.createElement creates an object which is converted to html element when rendered to DOM using root.render().

* JSX is not HTML in JS. It is rather an HTML or XML like syntax but different from them.

* Babel is a transpiler that converts JSX elements to React elements (JS objects) which is then converted to HTML elements before being rendered to DOM.

* Component composition means to compose components into one another (nesting components together).
